# Glycopeptide Proteoform Generator

Richard Shipman -- 2024 

GitHub: https://github.com/RichardDShipman

This repository contains a Python script for processing glycopeptides data to generate text files with proteoforms from combinations of glycopeptides across the glycosylation sites found for a protein. The script reads glycopeptides data from a CSV file, groups and formats the data, and generates proteoforms with a configurable limit on the number of combinations. Results are saved to text files and CSV files in the data folder.

## Features

- **Read and Process Data**: Reads glycopeptides data from a CSV file and processes it to create a structured dictionary of glycopeptides grouped by protein.
- **Generate Proteoforms**: Generates combinations of glycosylation for peptides and creates all possible proteoforms, with a limit on the number of proteoforms generated to manage large datasets.
- **Output Results**: Saves proteoform counts to a CSV file and detailed proteoform information to individual text files for each protein.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- itertools

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Input File**

   Ensure you have a CSV file named `glycopeptides.csv` in the same directory as the script. The CSV file should contain the following columns:

   - `protein`: The protein identifier.
   - `glycosylation_site`: The site of glycosylation.
   - `glycan`: The glycan composition.

   Example CSV format:

   ```csv
   protein,peptide,glycosylation_site,glycan
   ACAN,TVYVHAnQTGYPDPSSR,343,N5H5F1S0G0
   ACAN,SnDSGVYR,132,N2H6F0S0G0
   ```

2. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python glycopeptide_proteoform_generator_cmd.py -i glycopeptides.csv -l 10
   ```

   - **-i**: input CSV file with glycopeptides.
   - **-l**: limit the number of proteoforms generated for each protein.

   The script will process the data, generate proteoforms, and write the results to the `data` folder and `00_proteoform_counts.csv` & `01_merged_proteoforms_glycopeptides.csv` files.

3. **Output Files**

   - **data**: Contains text files named `<protein>_proteoforms.txt` for each protein, detailing the proteoforms generated and their components.
   - **00_proteoform_counts.csv**: Contains a CSV file with columns `protein` and `total_proteoforms`, listing the number of proteoforms generated for each protein.
   - **01_merged_proteoforms_glycopeptides.csv**: Contains a CSV file with merged proteoform data.

# Customization

- **Proteoform Limit**: You can adjust the limit parameter in the generate_proteoforms_with_limit function to control the maximum number of proteoforms generated per protein. Setting an appropriate limit is important, as glycoproteins can generate millions of possible proteoforms, which may quickly exhaust computational resources and storage.

- **NOTE**: If you set the limit above 10 million proteoforms, be prepared for high memory usage and significant processing time. Output text files for large limits can exceed 1GB in size, especially if glycopeptide data involves complex glycosylation patterns across many glycosylation sites.

## Preparing Glycopeptides.csv Data

**Prepare the Input File**

   Ensure `glycopeptides.csv` is in the same directory as the script. The CSV should have the following columns: `protein`, `glycosylation_site`, and `glycan`.
